  I'm a software engineer with over ten years' experience, based in the North West of the UK.


  I specialise in web technologies, generally focused around React and its ecosystem, but I've worked in golang, Java, PHP, and some eldritch horrors I won't name for fear of summoning them from whence they are banished.
