  I've been a software developer for a while now - 10 years, in fact.


  My career has outlasted Google Glass, Vine, and the Windows phone.
  
  I have colleagues now who don't even remember those things.

  
  But I'm still here, and not yet shouting at clouds. Still building, still learning, still think good software tends to be built under good conditions, so I try to foster them.
