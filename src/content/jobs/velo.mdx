Few roles offer the variety that I enjoyed in this position. I built greenfield projects for the web using Next.js and Remix, maintained and migrated older platforms from create-react-app tooling to Vite (and in some cases to micro-frontend architectures), and did a significant amount of mobile development in both Swift and React Native.

The work itself spanned various intricate payment use cases, typically involving itemised payment disbursements or utilizing the APIs made available by the Open Banking standard to orchestrate peer-to-peer transfers and access account information.
