This was a formative career experience, working on an important high-throughput commercial banking platform. The work centred on replacing the legacy platform with a suite of modern counterparts; replicating and augmenting the functionality of a monolithic Java application a suite of micro frontends and microservices. I worked on both, specialising in the frontend.

There was also, unsurprisingly, a lot of regulatory change occurring within the platform: Open Banking, PSD2, Strong Customer Authentication, and Confirmation of Payee all required implementation during my time with the group. Some of these I implemented, others I assisted in the high-level solution design of.

My favourite element of the role was being able to take accountability for accessibility within certain areas of the application while pursuing WCAG AA compliance; this involved routine auditing of the application, collaborating with specialists to implement solutions to issues, and ultimately becoming part of founding cohort of a business-wide Community of Practice.
